Written a Java code that creates a calculator to perform the four basic arithmetic operations (addition,subtraction,multiplication and division)
I have submitted two different source codes with two outputs since I have created one with switch case and the other with Loop.
You must use the following:


Have used the following for developing the calculator :

Eclipse/IntelliJ: An IDE to code for the application
Java: A programming language
Git: To connect and push files from the local system to GitHub
GitHub: To store the application code and track its versions
Core Java concepts: Variables, data types, operators, type casting, control statements, class, objects, access specifiers, and core keywords like final, this, and static
 

Following requirements are met:

The versions of the code should be tracked on GitHub repositories.
The calculator should work properly.
